# Name Sorter

This repository contains a simple Java program that sorts a list of names based on the last name. The program uses Java 7 and demonstrates a custom sorting algorithm, specifically the Bubble Sort, to arrange the names in ascending order by their last names.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
3. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE or text editor.

## Sorting Algorithm: Bubble Sort

The program employs the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the names based on the last name. Bubble Sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Example

Suppose you have the following list of names:

    Hugh Miliation
    Christian Mingle
    Juan Soponatime
    Dante Sinferno
    Orson Milka Iddins
    Pat Agonia
    Erna Dorey Battelle

Running the program will sort the names based on the last name:

    Pat Agonia
    Erna Dorey Battelle
    Orson Milka Iddins
    Hugh Miliation
    Christian Mingle
    Dante Sinferno
    Juan Soponatime

## Java Version

The program is written in Java 7 and does not use any Java 8 features. It provides a simple and straightforward implementation of the name sorting functionality using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
